				That’s how I spend most of time on TikTok. Right now, it’s my most used app and Apple loves to remind me every Sunday about how much time I spend on the app. I hate to admit it, but last week I spent a total of 21 hours and 7 minutes on TikTok. Think of any topic in the world ... Got it? Well, there’s probably a niche “tok” for it. From books to food to even AC units - TikTok seems to have it all. It’s an app that brings people together. 

			</p> 

			<p class="script-paragraph-5"> 

				It felt like in March 2020, everyone was on this app. It’s crazy to think back on how much time was spent on this app and how it was somewhat… an obsession?

			<p class="script-paragraph-6"> 

				According to<a href="https://backlinko.com/tiktok-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Backlinko</a>, a site that tracks SEO trends and provides strategies to get more recognition, American’s 18 and over spent 1.43 billion hours on the app in March 2020. On average, U.S. adult users were spending around 33 minutes per day on TikTok, putting them second in daily engagement. Facebook is first with 35 minutes per day.

				That last one made me feel a bit better about my weekly average. But TikTok isn’t so much about the viewers, it’s about the content creators. With some getting a bit recognition, and then a huge following. One of the main reasons being… COVID-19. Now I know it’s been 2 years since quarantine, but in a way TikTok became an outlet for some. For people like, Brandon Edelman, a full-time content creator, the 15 second videos helped take his mind off the current events.

				I found the shorter streaming content was easier for me to digest than like starting a new TV show or like watching YouTube videos that were really long. It was definitely easier for my attention span at that time, which was already wearing thin just with everything going on.

				Brandon didn’t download TikTok until January 2021, but that was still a time where we unsure of the future despite some finally getting access to COVID vaccines. But let’s go back even further. March 2020 was a trying time with going on lockdown and having to quarantine. Quarantine was very much a stop [pause for 5 seconds] and reflect time period. There was no more rushing to work or school, we were stuck at home waiting for normalcy to come back.

				I had never dealt with anxiety, depression, all that like mental illness until COVID happened. But COVID, I let myself go mentally, physically, emotionally in all sorts. And I think TikTok was a fun way of just making it an outlet. Um, my videos originally started blowing up when I was just going on rants and talking crazy, and it definitely helped with my emotional state at the time.

				It took me about three months before my first video ever blew up. And I still remember that video the same week that my first video started going crazy on TikTok. Uh, someone by the name of Jhanlee Castillo, which is my mother agent Uh, contact me on Instagram and was like, “yo, I'm this and that a mother agent. And there's a client of mine that wants to sign you to his agency.” 

				At first I thought it wasn't real at all. I thought it was like, you know, just the scam or something. And the more I looked into it, the more real it seem.

And then like a few weeks later I had another video get like 240,000 views. A similar situation, like got like 2- 3000 followers from that.

				And then like around July 4th, that weekend I was like at the beach with my friends and we were posting like a bunch of just like really funny content. Um, and then I hit 10,000 followers, um, like July 9th, 2021.

Um, and we passed by this like salon and there's a cat in the window and it's just like chilling there. So. I was just like, you know, I'm gonna just make like a joking video.

				And I'm just yelling at the cat and the cat is just staring at me like, like dead eyes. And we were just like making jokes about that. And now we went from like 10K and I got to like, I think 45K in a night, like, uh, followers. So I jumped a lot. That one, I was like, okay, I jumped a lot on this one.

				I didn't really try Instagram, but Instagram is like the hardest platform to blow up on. Um, but I tried YouTube wasn't working and then I saw TikTok as like the new Vine. So I jumped on it before, like it could blow up even more. Everyone was like, TikTok fucking corny. Like it was like still that time where they're like, you fucking do TikToks. And I remember, cause I was like, I was working at North Face, the one right there in Soho. Yeah. I was like, I downloaded it and like, I'm making, like, telling my coworkers. I'm like, yo, like my friend Janet worked there cause she got me the job. And I was like, yo, like Janet, make a TikTok with me. She was like, you make fucking TikToks? And she started like roasting me and everyone at my job was like, you fucking make like- just flaming me.

				And I would be talking to my friends all day and I'd be like, yo, I could like do this. And, and I would like to thank my homies most of all, because a lot of them they made fun of me, but they were really supportive. Like, like if I would make like a, what you would call a thirst trap, they would make fun of me. But like they would support me and be like, yo, keep doing it, keep doing it. Cause you got it. It's going to take. It may- It may not be today or tomorrow, but if you keep posting, I know something's going to happen.

				The point here is, just about any topic can make you go viral on TikTok. An app that first started with 15 seconds, content creators had to grab viewers’ attention in such a short time. Now, videos can go for as long as 10 minutes. Making a TikTok takes time but the amount of time is different for each content creator. You have to figure out the content and what the best time to post is. For Bryan…

				He keeps them saved and posts them at 4 or 5 PM. But, Luis studied his algorithm and he posts exactly at 9:32 PM. Here’s his thought process:

			<p class="script-name"> 

				LUIS BARBOSA [1:05.877 seconds]

			<p class="script-paragraph-33"> 

				So I was like, thinking about myself, like, when am I usually on my phone? Right. Cause there's also people that like, if you don't work a 9 to 5, you know, you're a college kid, you're working a retail job. You're doing. You know, uh, probably have classes in the morning or, and then you work like the, say 3 to 8, 3 to 10, like, you know, whenever. So I kinda just figured out and then I was like, everyone goes to bed around 10 o'clock like, if you have like a busy day, the next day, or like early classes or whatever, or like, if you're like a kid with a bedtime, you're most likely going to bed around like 10. Like 10:30, 11. So I was like, I feel like 9:32 was like a calm spot in between like getting home, showering and just like resting in bed and just like being on your phone, like doing nothing. So then I posted like 9:30 and then the video kind of did okay. I posted at 9:32 and then that video did like numbers. Like, um, like I think it did like 4 million. Then the next day I pulled out like 9:35, the video did okay. So then I was like, maybe we should just post at 9:32, I post at 9:32 another viral video.

				is a part of the TikTok partner program. That means he works with someone who works at TikTok that will kind of give him tips on his content.

				When TikTok came out, I would say TikTok before like they started adding ads and adding everything else. What they would do is they'll send it to 500 people randomly if you put a hashtag or go to the people who like that sort of hashtag stuff, videos in general. So it goes of those 500 people more narrowed down and then like it takes them to like they like if like, let's say a 10th of them like it, it'll go to the next batch to a thousand people. Once it goes to 50,000 likes or views, there's like a moderator who looks at the content to make sure like, it's not going to get in trouble. That's how you really get followers like the first 500 likes you get and then after that it's like depend on how good the video is is pretty much anybody can get viral.

				on their website. Here’s a quick summary of the tips that TikTok’s creator team says on how to get more views:  

				<ul>

					<li>First: Add captions, hashtags, and sounds to your videos to help viewers find the content</li>
					<li>Second: Film vertically</li>
					<li>And lastly: When looking at your TikTok analytics make note of the high level trends and how viewers are engaging with your content</li>

				</ul>
		    </p>

		    <p class="script-paragraph-40"> 

		    	On the other hand, here’s some content that the creator team said will be was flagged as “probably not making it to your ‘For You Page’”:

				<ul>

					<li>First up: Overly erotic or sensual content </li>
					<li>Unoriginal or clickbaity content</li>
					<li>Shock value or distressing content</li>
					<li>Content hyping up tobacco products</li>
					<li>And, content that promotes extreme dieting, crazy stunts, or dangerous sports performed by amateurs.</li>

				</ul>
		    </p>

		    <p class="script-paragraph-41"> 

		    	The creator team did stress that low engagement doesn’t always mean it was “ineligible for the For You feed.” But going back to going viral.

I’ve learned that TikTok is an app that you never know what’s going to happen. Just look at what’s done for all these content creators. But it’s not just that, it provided an escape from harsh reality and the overwhelming nature that COVID brought into our lives.

						But why center a capstone around a social media app? TikTok has become my most used app since I downloaded it in March 2020. It became my escape from what was really happening in the world and really helped with my mental stability at the time. I really wanted my capstone to showcase my interests in the app as well as delve deep into what the app has done for others who used it as platform.
