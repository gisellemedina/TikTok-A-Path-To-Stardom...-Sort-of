				Right now, it‚Äôs my most used app and Apple loves to remind me every Sunday how much time I spend on the app. I hate to admit it, but last week I spent a total of 21 hours and 7 minutes on TikTok. Think of any topic in the world. [PAUSE] Got it? Well, there‚Äôs probably a niche ‚Äútok‚Äù for it. From books to food to even AC units - whatever you‚Äôre into - you can find people on TikTok talking about it.

				It felt like in March 2020, everyone was on this app. According to <a href="https://backlinko.com/tiktok-users" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backlinko</a>, a site that tracks SEO trends, Americans 18 and over spent more than a  billion hours on the app in March 2020. On average, U.S. adult users were spending 33 minutes per day on TikTok, just two minutes less than Facebook. But that‚Äôs just an AVERAGE ‚Äì a lot of people were spending HOURS a day on the app. I asked some friends to check their phones to see how many hours they logged per week on the app:

				I had never dealt with anxiety, depression, all that- like mental illness until COVID happened. I let myself go mentally, physically, emotionally in all sorts. And I think TikTok was a fun way of just making an outlet. Um, my videos originally started blowing up when I was just going on rants and talking crazy, and it definitely helped with my emotional state at the time.

And there's a client of mine that wants to sign you to his agency.‚Äù

				The point here is, just about any topic can make you go viral on TikTok - and it's very hard to predict when it will happen. When it started, TikTok only allowed you to create 15-second videos, so content creators had to grab viewers‚Äô attention quickly. Now, videos can go for as long as 10 minutes. Making a TikTok takes time and effort. Creators have to strategize about when to post their videos. Luis studied his algorithm and he posts exactly at 9:32 P.M.

				I was like, thinking about myself, like, when am I usually on my phone? If you have like a busy day the next day, or like early classes or whatever, or like, if you're like a kid with a bedtime, you're most likely going to bed around like 10 like 10:30, 11. So, I feel like 9:32 was like a calm spot in between like getting home showering and just like resting in bed and just like being on your phone, like doing nothing. So then I posted like 9:30 and then the video kind of did okay. I posted at 9:32 and then that video did like numbers. Like, um, like I think it did like 4 million, then the next day I pulled out like 9:35, the video did okay. So then I was like, maybe we should just post at 9:32, I post at 9:32 another viral video.

				For those who DO manage to go viral on TikTok - it can be life-changing. In the past couple of years, we've seen a bunch of TikTok stars score invites to the Oscars, movie premieres, and things like that. It‚Äôs an app that has jump-started people‚Äôs acting or modeling careers. Bryan witnessed this firsthand back in 2021 when he did...

					I've been inside of my apartment with major anxiety for the past 13 days. Cause I didn't even know if I was going to have a job after I came out of quarantine. And I was just like, I was at my lowest point. I was like, maybe New York is not for me. Yada, yada, yada. Um, I sent the video. I looked horrible, but I gave it my all. And a couple of days later, I got the call. It was like, and I'll never forget the tone in his voice because I landed us. What was it? A $7,000 job. And he just said, 'Hey, Bryan, how you doing? You just got green lit for Steve Madden and the money is this, this and that.‚Äô And, uh, you're good. And I was like, okay. And then I hung up the phone and I'm pretty sure that people in Uptown heard me when I was screaming.

			<p class="paragraph-1"> 

				After almost two years on TikTok, I have come to the conclusion that it can influence me to do anything. I have saved so many TikTok videos on Trader Joe's finds, hair and make-up products, and all the restaurants I want to go to in New York City. Saving these videos has expanded my knowledge and led me to try different things that I otherwise wouldn‚Äôt have (I‚Äôve even learned how to make muffins, properly dermaplane my skin, and keep my curls shiny).

				<a href="https://go.sensortower.com/rs/351-RWH-315/images/Sensor-Tower-Q1-2022-Data-Digest.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">analytics firm Sensor Tower</a>. The social media platform has gone from a ‚Äúdancing app‚Äù to a marketing tool for some people. It has had a significant cultural influence specifically among

					responding to a fan‚Äôs question on how they got into TikTok, Gurley gave a list of tips on their journey. To sum up their response: pick a brand/niche and stick to it. Before ending the video, they say, ‚Äúbut seriously being a content creator is a job of a lifetime.‚Äù

					What it means to be a content creator never crossed my mind until my cousin, Mauricio Hernandez, started to really pursue it towards the end of 2019. He went from posting his hair routine on TikTok to walking in New York Fashion Week two years in a row. Now 20, he has done a couple of brand deals with companies like Nike, Jimmy Jazz, and Urban Skin Rx. These are essentially brand partnerships where a content creator collaborates with a brand in exchange for money or a stipend.

					‚ÄúIf there's brands that I want to work with, but they maybe haven't reached out to me. Sometimes I'll spend a day emailing them with my rates and my portfolio and just being like, ‚ÄòHere's what I can do, I'd love to partner together,‚Äù says full-time content creator Brandon Edelman who now has a little over

				But Edelman didn‚Äôt start off as a full-time content creator. He had a couple of jobs in the past year, with his most recent being the social media manager for a company that had reached out to him because of his TikTok presence. But, he didn‚Äôt like the constraints that came with making TikTok videos for a company. According to him, it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúcreative stimulating.‚Äù

			<p class="paragraph-9"> 

				‚ÄúI never felt like I had a direction or a clear path of where I wanted to grow, whereas now I feel amazing about where I am and I love my job and there's so many different avenues in terms of growth,‚Äù Edelman says. ‚ÄúIt's nice to see the work you put in directly reflect. What comes out in 9-to-5 culture, I felt sometimes I'd work really hard and not get recognition, but now working for myself, when I see a video go viral and I did that or like, when I see people responding to something in a positive way, I'm like, that was really good on my part.‚Äù
				
			</p>


			<p class="paragraph-10"> 

				As a full-time content creator, Edelman went from a 9-to-5 job to a 24-hour one. ‚ÄúI film everything I do,‚Äù he says. His mornings consist of meetings, filming two videos a day, brainstorming future content, filming ads, replying to comments (either with a video or just a text comment), and going to events.

			</p>

			<p class="paragraph-11"> 

				Usually, Edelman or his manager will send an email introducing themselves and attaching his analytics including his viewership and his audience‚Äôs demographic. ‚ÄúBusinesses are gonna wanna see if that matches their clientele and the customer that they're trying to reach,‚Äù he says.

						Malibu Rum approached Edelman‚Äôs manager to attend their activation/booth for the Firefly Music Festival which happened towards the end of September 2022. Edelman only needed to create an 
						
						<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ci5R-fdjbkq/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram reel</a> promoting the brand's setup at the festival. ‚ÄúThe process was pretty seamless,‚Äù says Edelman. ‚ÄúWe had a call with the Malibu team for them to run through what to expect at the booth and discussing concepts for the reel. I suggested incorporating Malibu into a "Day in My Life" video and they loved that idea so that is what we did.‚Äù

					</p>
					
					<p class="paragraph-14"> 

						Due to legalities, Edelman could not share the payment amount. But when creating the content, the reel took about 1.5 hours to make ‚Äî a half hour to film and an hour to edit the raw footage. He was also able to travel to Delaware and attend three out of the four days of the festival in order to complete the partnership.

					</p>

					<p class="paragraph-15"> 

						‚ÄúA lot of brands want different things at different times,‚Äù says content creator Mackenzie Skye. She‚Äôs had partnerships where the brands work very closely with her right down to the formulation of captions while others give her full creative freedom as long as the content in the video is discussed beforehand.

						Skye joined TikTok in 2019, a time when TikTok was slowly becoming more popular before fully becoming a top social media app during the pandemic. She now has almost 

						<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mackenzie.skye?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">310 thousand followers with 8 million likes</a>. Around 2-3 years ago, she did a month-long partnership with North Face. They sent her a variety of winter gear including a big winter jacket, a thinner jacket, a duffle bag, leggings, and a shirt. Skye was told to go on hiking trips, and use specific viral sounds and captions to build the content for them - content that took her roughly 5-6 hours to create. Sometimes she‚Äôd have to redo videos if the logo didn‚Äôt really show or something wasn‚Äôt aesthetically pleasing. ‚ÄúI feel it‚Äôs like that with any brand that you work with because you have to send in [the videos] and make sure that it's accepted and approved before they're like, ‚ÄòOkay, go ahead and post that,‚Äô‚Äù says Skye. And from that month-long deal, she was paid around $1,000 and kept all the items, still wearing today the thinner yellow and black zip-up coat.

			<p class="paragraph-17"> 

				In her experience, brand deal payments vary from $500 to $5,000 if not more for just one video. This was easy living for Skye three years ago when she lived with her mom. For independence, she moved out, and to sustain her life in North Carolina, she‚Äôs gone from full-time content creator to working as a receptionist at a hair salon. With working around 24 hours a week and babysitting during her free time, TikTok has been on the back burner for Skye.

			</p>

			<p class="paragraph-18"> 

				‚ÄúAt one point, I stopped working completely because I was like, ‚ÄòI want to do social media, I want to put all my time into this,‚Äô but the brand deals weren't coming in fast enough to pay my bills,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSo right now, I definitely could not pay my bills with social media, like absolutely not because the brand deals have not been as much.‚Äù

			</p>

			<p class="paragraph-19"> 

				But as many full-time content creators emphasize, in order to make it your full-time income, consistency is key. In pursuit of this as a full-time career, Skye has a calendar that her manager Sammy Wroge created to gain more follower traction. ‚ÄúWe're hoping that I'll start gaining followers again and can actually do more brand deals that are paid.‚Äù

			</p>

			<p class="paragraph-20"> 

				Beyond brand deals, there‚Äôs the TikTok Creator Fund - the app‚Äôs way of ‚Äúcelebrating and supporting creators for their dedication, ingenuity, and spirit,‚Äù according to the app‚Äôs  

				<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/creator-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. The $200 million fund launched in July 2020 with a seemingly straightforward proposal: apply, make a video, and get money.

			</p>

			<p class="paragraph-21"> 

				However creators have to meet certain criteria in order to apply: they have to be 18 years or older, have a minimum of 100,000 views, have three posts in the past month, have 10,000 followers, and follow community guidelines. However, upon its launch, there were 

				<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-creators-fund-revenue-sharing-complaints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conspiracies</a> alleging that TikTok doesn‚Äôt pay their creators and even some people have suggested that creators in the fund have had their viewership go down. The content creator needs views to get the Creator Fund coin. But there is no evidence to prove these claims and TikTok has 

				<a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-fund-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">denied</a> it. ‚ÄúBeing in the Creator Fund has no direct impact on the TikTok recommendation system,‚Äù TikTok says in their September 2020 statement. ‚ÄúOn TikTok, For You feed recommendations reflect preferences unique to each user and the recommendation system doesn't know whether or not a creator is part of the Creator Fund.‚Äù In the first place, the statement asserts that TikTok is not deliberately bringing down one‚Äôs viewership, a video gets more recognition based on the views and likes the video is gaining. Secondly, the statement also says funds are calculated based on factors like video views, video engagement, and authenticity of a view. Ending their statement with ‚Äúlike video views, funds are therefore dynamic,‚Äù meaning that it depends on viewership and is different for each content creator.

			</p>

					<p class="paragraph-22"> 

						Edelman joined the fund over a year ago as another source of income. ‚ÄúBefore I had brand deals, it was encouraging me to continue to post,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbecause I was like, ‚ÄòHey, I can get like an extra $300 this month just from posting on TikTok,‚Äô at that time I was making 40K a year at my job.‚Äù In a 

						<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/creator-fund/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok video</a> posted in July, Edelman breaks it down. In a year, he made $5,000 from being in the fund, which makes it clear that creators cannot exactly live off the fund. 
 

					</p>

					<p class="paragraph-23"> 

						‚ÄúIf this was my yearly salary, obviously I wouldn‚Äôt be alive right now,‚Äù he says in the video. ‚ÄúI would never ever recommend anybody quitting their job and relying solely on TikTok Creator Fund money.‚Äù

					</p>

					<p class="paragraph-24"> 

						For Edelman, he sees Creator Fund money to be more of a passive stream of income in addition to brand partnerships, helping pay a portion of rent or a coffee, not something to heavily rely on. ‚ÄúBut it's always good,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMoney's great, so it's always good to have.‚Äù

					</p>
					
					<p class="paragraph-25"> 

						When it comes to TikTok, as viewers, we are shown somewhat a romanticized version of what it‚Äôs like being a content creator from seeing their name-brand unboxing videos to being invited to special events because of the number of followers they have. The social media app has become a full-time job with building a following and constantly creating original content. And without really intending to, at first, content creators have become catalysts for influencing people.
